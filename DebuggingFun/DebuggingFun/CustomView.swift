        In general you can control the flow by writing \"continue\" and \"step in\". But now we're going to learn how to not only set a brekapoint.
        We're going to edit a breakpoint to execute a command and not any command, We're going to make them play a sound and continue.
        I would like you to set a breakpoint on the method tink. step twice (with s) and now you add a command with
        breakpoint command add <breakpt-id>, for example: br com add 1
        you can add sounds, conditions and even add --autocontinue. For now add 'bt' and hit DONE to get a backtrace and look at the methods listed
